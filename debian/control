Description: Latest nvidia driver for System76 computers
 This dummy package depends on the latest driver tested with and recommended for
 System76 products with an nvidia GPU.
 .
 When this package is installed, you will automatically be upgraded to newer
 nvidia driver versions after System76 has thouroughly tested them.
 .
 This driver will generally depend on a newer nvidia driver than the official
 nvidia-current-updates Ubuntu package.
 .
 If you don't want to be automatically upgraded to newer nvidia drivers, simply
 remove this package.
