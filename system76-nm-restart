# Starting with 16.04, there are WiFi reliability issues when resuming from
# suspend, at least with certain WiFi cards.  In particular, this problem seems
# to effect Haswell generation cards like the 7260.  It does not seem to effect
# Skylake generation cards like the 3165, 8260.
#
# This seems fundamentally a user-space issue, not a kernel issue.
